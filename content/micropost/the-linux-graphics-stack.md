> This is an introductory overview post for the Linux Graphics Stack,
> and how it currently all fits together. I initially wrote it for
> myself after having conversations with people like Owen Taylor, Ray
> Strode and Adam Jackson about this stack. I had to go back to them
> every month or so and learn the stuff from the ground up all over
> again, as I had forgotten every single piece. I asked them for a good
> high-level overview document so I could stop bothering them. They
> didnâ€™t know of any. I started this one. It has been reviewed by Adam
> Jackson and David Airlie, both of whom work on this exact stack.
