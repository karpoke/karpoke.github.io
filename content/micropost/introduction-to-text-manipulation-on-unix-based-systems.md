> A basic tenets of UNIX philosophy is to create programs (or processes)
> that do one thing, and do that one thing well. It is a philosophy
> demanding careful thought about interfaces and ways of joining these
> smaller (hopefully more simple) processes together to create useful
> results. Normally textual data flows between these interfaces. Over
> time, more and more advanced text processing tools and languages have
> been developed. For languages, earlier on there was perl, later came
> python, and ruby. While these and other languages are very capable
> text processors, such tools are not always available, especially in a
> production environment. In this article, a number of basic UNIX text
> processing commands are demonstrated and may be used individually or
> in conjunction with each other to solve problems which may also be
> addressed with newer languages. For many people, an example provides
> more information than long winded explanations. Please note because of
> the variety of UNIX and UNIX-like systems available, command flags,
> program behavior, and output differs between implementations.
