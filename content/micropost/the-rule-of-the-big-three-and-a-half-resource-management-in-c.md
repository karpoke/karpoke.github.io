> The dynamic creation and destruction of objects was always one of the
> bugbears of C. It required the programmer to (manually) control the
> allocation of memory for the object, handle the object’s
> initialisation then ensure that the object was safely cleaned-up after
> use and its memory returned to the heap. Because many C programmers
> weren’t educated in the potential problems (or were just plain lazy or
> delinquent in their programming) C got a reputation in some quarters
> for being an unsafe, memory-leaking language.
