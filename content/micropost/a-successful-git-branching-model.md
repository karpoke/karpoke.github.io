> In this post I present the development model that I’ve introduced for
> all of my projects (both at work and private) about a year ago, and
> which has turned out to be very successful. I’ve been meaning to write
> about it for a while now, but I’ve never really found the time to do
> so thoroughly, until now. I won’t talk about any of the projects’
> details, merely about the branching strategy and release management.
