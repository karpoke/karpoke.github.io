> CSS Layout is all about boxes. We know that some boxes are blocks, and others
> are inline, and we can change the display type of elements by changing the
> value of the display property. That property holds the key to much more than
> this, however. It is the foundation on which all layout is built; the core of
> the inbuilt CSS layout system. Learning Grid Layout, or Flexbox, without
> understanding Display, leaves you with a wobbly foundation and more questions
> than answers.
> The real question isn’t “Should I use Grid or Flexbox?” but instead, “How do
> I want these boxes to behave?” Understanding the interaction between layout
> methods will enable you to easily create fallbacks for older browsers, and
> knowing how the various formatting contexts behave unlocks margin collapsing
> and the behavior of items inside grid or flex layout. By the end of the hour,
> you’ll understand how the display property underpins the layout system we
> have today, the things coming in the future, and be able to make more
> informed decisions when deciding how to build any part of your design, big or
> small.
