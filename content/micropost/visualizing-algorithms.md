> Algorithms are a fascinating use case for visualization. To visualize
> an algorithm, we donâ€™t merely fit data to a chart; there is no primary
> dataset. Instead there are logical rules that describe behavior. This
> may be why algorithm visualizations are so unusual, as designers
> experiment with novel forms to better communicate. This is reason
> enough to study them. But algorithms are also a reminder that
> visualization is more than a tool for finding patterns in data.
> Visualization leverages the human visual system to augment human
> intellect: we can use it to better understand these important abstract
> processes, and perhaps other things, too.
