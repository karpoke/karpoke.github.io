> buyers resented the non-functionality of their backups, they hated the
> loss of scarce ports to the authentication dongles, and they chafed at
> the inconvenience of having to lug around large manuals when they
> wanted to run their software. Second, these didn’t stop pirates, who
> found it trivial to patch the software and bypass authentication.
> People who took the software without paying for it were untouched.
