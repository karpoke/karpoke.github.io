> “Rowhammer” is a problem with some recent DRAM devices in which
> repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent
> rows. We tested a selection of laptops and found that a subset of them
> exhibited the problem. We built two working privilege escalation
> exploits that use this effect. One exploit uses rowhammer-induced bit
> flips to gain kernel privileges on x86-64 Linux when run as an
> unprivileged userland process. When run on a machine vulnerable to the
> rowhammer problem, the process was able to induce bit flips in page
> table entries (PTEs). It was able to use this to gain write access to
> its own page table, and hence gain read-write access to all of
> physical memory.
