> Since 2004, I’ve owned a ThinkPad A22m - a laptop that came out in

> do everything I need while still letting me run modern software.

> Specifically, I am talking about open source ATI drivers on GNU /
> Linux. The four main video card lines released by ATI (now owned by
> AMD) have been Wonder, Mach, Rage and Radeon. I don’t think Wonder
> cards have any features that would warrant the development of a
> dedicated driver but Linux drivers for the other three have been
> written.

> The Radeon driver is actively maintained by software engineers at AMD
> and some people who work for other software companies. The other two?
> Not so much. The Rage 128 driver was especially in need of a major
> update recently. And since my computer has a Rage Mobility graphics
> card, I felt motivated to start working on the code even though I had
> never hacked such a low-level piece of software before. Since the
> effort has largely succeeded, I would like to share my experiences
> with editing an open source video driver. The learning curve was quite
> steep and when I first started reading documentation, it seemed like
> it was written for a different audience. This post is going to be an
> unadultered attempt to get a completely new reader to catch on to what
> I did. I’m sure I will later find out that many things written in this
> post are technically incorrect, but I will not edit them. I want the
> only knowledge communicated in this piece to be the knowledge that one
> might reasonably be expected to have after jumping into driver
> development for the first time.
