> HTTPS-protected sites, mail servers, and other widely used Internet
> services. A team of security researchers has discovered a new attack,
> dubbed Logjam, that allows a man-in-the-middle (MitM) to downgrade
> encrypted connections between a user and a Web or email server to use
> extremely weaker 512-bit keys which can be easily decrypted.
