> You must have heard about The Internet map by now. If not, you can
> take a look at it here. Roughly speaking, the Internet Map displays
> websites’ location according to users’ behavior. Similar websites
> visited by the same people are situated close to one another;
> different websites not having mutual visitors are situated at a
> considerable distance from each other. The size of a website on the
> map is determined by its average click rating while the color is
> defined by belonging to a nationality. You can get a more detailed
> notion referring to the About section on the website of the Map.
>
> In the present article I would like to tell you how the website of The
> Internet map is organized, which technologies ensure its normal
> day-to-day functioning and what steps had to be taken in order to
> sustain a massive surge of visitors wishing to have a look at the map.
>
> The operability of the Internet Map is enabled by present-day
> internet-giants’ technologies: the Map’s visual display is powered by
> Google Maps engine by Google Inc., web query processing is performed
> with Microsoft’s .net technologies, while Amazon Web Services by
> Amazon is responsible for hosting and content delivery. All the three
> components are vital for the Map’s normal operation. With some effort,
> alternatives can be found, but I am not confident that it will bring
> much of a benefit.
