> The thing to remember, above all else when writing JS code, is that
> it’s a dynamic language. This means there are a lot of ways to do
> things. You don’t have to deal with strongly typed classes, or some of
> the more complex features from languages, like C\# and Java. This is
> both a blessing and a curse.

> You can read an article on the history of JavaScript here, but the
> gist of it is that Brandon Eich, in 1995, was hired by Netscape to
> design a language. What he came up with was the loosely typed language
> that we know as JavaScript. Over the years, it became ”standardized”
> as ECMAscript, but, throughout all the browser wars, the various
> browsers implemented these features differently. This, naturally, lead
> to a lot of sleepless nights for web developers. This problem, when
> combined with the fact that JavaScript was considered to be most
> applicable for manipulating images and performing quick bits of
> validation, led JavaScript to, incorrectly, be viewed as a terrible
> language.
