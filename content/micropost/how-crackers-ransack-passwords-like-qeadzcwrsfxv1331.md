> In March, readers followed along as Nate Anderson, Ars deputy editor

> more than 16,000 cryptographically hashed passcodes. Within a few
> hours, he deciphered almost half of them. The moral of the story: if a
> reporter with zero training in the ancient art of password cracking
> can achieve such results, imagine what more seasoned attackers can do.
>
> Imagine no more. We asked three cracking experts to attack the same
> list Anderson targeted and recount the results in all their color and
> technical detail Iron Chef style. The results, to say the least, were
> eye opening because they show how quickly even long passwords with
> letters, numbers, and symbols can be discovered.
