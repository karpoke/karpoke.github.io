> The TTY subsystem is central to the design of Linux, and UNIX in
> general. Unfortunately, its importance is often overlooked, and it is
> difficult to find good introductory articles about it. I believe that
> a basic understanding of TTYs in Linux is essential for the developer
> and the advanced user.

> Beware, though: What you are about to see is not particularly elegant.
> In fact, the TTY subsystem ” while quite functional from a user’s
> point of view ” is a twisty little mess of special cases. To
> understand how this came to be, we have to go back in time.
