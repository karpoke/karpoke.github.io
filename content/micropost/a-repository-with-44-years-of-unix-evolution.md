> The evolution of the Unix operating system is made available as a
> version-control repository, covering the period from its inception in
> 1972 as a five thousand line kernel, to 2015 as a widely-used 26
> million line system. The repository contains 659 thousand commits and
> 2306 merges. The repository employs the commonly used Git system for
> its storage, and is hosted on the popular GitHub archive. It has been
> created by synthesizing with custom software 24 snapshots of systems
> developed at Bell Labs, Berkeley University, and the 386BSD team, two
> legacy repositories, and the modern repository of the open source
> FreeBSD system. In total, 850 individual contributors are identified,
> the early ones through primary research. The data set can be used for
> empirical research in software engineering, information systems, and
> software archaeology.
