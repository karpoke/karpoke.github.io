> This scientific visualization of a computer simulation depicts the
> inevitable collision between our Milky Way galaxy and the Andromeda
> galaxy (also known as Messier 31). NASA Hubble Space Telescope
> observations indicate that the two galaxies, pulled together by their
> mutual gravity, will crash together in a near-head-on collision about
> 4 billion years from now. The thin disk shapes of these spiral
> galaxies are strongly distorted and irrevocably transformed by the
> encounter. Around 6 billion years from now, the two galaxies will
> merge to form a single elliptical galaxy.
