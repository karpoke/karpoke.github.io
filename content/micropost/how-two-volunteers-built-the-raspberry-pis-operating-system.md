> When you buy a Raspberry Pi, the \$35 computer doesn’t come with an
> operating system. Loading your operating system of choice onto an SD
> card and then booting the Pi turns out to be pretty easy. But where do
> Pi-compatible operating systems come from?
>
> With the Raspberry Pi having just turned one year old, we decided to
> find out how Raspbian”the officially recommended Pi operating
> system”came into being. The project required 60-hour work weeks, a
> home-built cluster of ARM computers, and the rebuilding of 19,000
> Linux software packages. And it was all accomplished by two
> volunteers.
