> The Object-Oriented Design Principles are the core of OOP programming, but I
> have seen most of the Java programmers chasing design patterns like
> Singleton pattern, Decorator pattern, or Observer pattern, and not putting
> enough attention on learning Object-oriented analysis and design. It’s
> important to learn the basics of Object-oriented programming like
> Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance. But, at the same
