> There are no definites with color. Sure, you have your red, your green, and
> so on — but even that is relative. Try to describe a specific red color to a
> friend. Chances are the description will settle on, for example, is the color
> more of a brick-red or a fire truck-red?
> Describing a color that looks similar to another color is natural way to
> discuss or express color. But when getting into specifics — accurately
> defining what it a certain color is — it’s almost impossible. Color, at its
> core, is a relative and personal experience.
