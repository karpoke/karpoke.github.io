> The rules of chess have remained consistent since the early 19th
> Century, but that doesn’t mean our approach to the game has stayed the
> same. Here are some intriguing and surprising ways the Game of Kings

> dates back 1,500 years, but it wasn’t until the introduction of
> competitive chess in 1834 that the rules were solidified. Since that
> time, players of all calibers have diligently worked to find new and
> better ways of winning.
