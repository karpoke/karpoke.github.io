> There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and
> networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the
> first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments.
> The members of this culture originated the term ’hacker’. Hackers
> built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is
> today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this
> culture, if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who
> you are and call you a hacker, you’re a hacker.
