> The problem we discussed is laid out in some detail in my Brain Drain
> post, but a quick summary is this: scientific research in many
> disciplines is becoming more and more dependent on the careful
> analysis of large datasets. This analysis requires a skill-set as
> broad as it is deep: scientists must be experts not only in their own
> domain, but in statistics, computing, algorithm building, and software
> design as well. Many researchers are working hard to attain these
> skills; the problem is that academia’s reward structure is not
> well-poised to reward the value of this type of work. In short, time
> spent developing high-quality reusable software tools translates to
> less time writing and publishing, which under the current system
> translates to little hope for academic career advancement. » Jake
