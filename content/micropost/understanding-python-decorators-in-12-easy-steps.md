> Ok, perhaps I jest. As a Python instructor, understanding decorators
> is a topic I find students consistently struggle with upon first
> exposure. That’s because decorators are hard to understand! Getting
> decorators requires understanding several functional programming
> concepts as well as feeling comfortable with some unique features of
> Python’s function definition and function calling syntax. \_Using\_
> decorators is easy (see Section 10)! But writing them can be
> complicated.

> I can’t make decorators easy - but maybe by walking through each piece
> of the puzzle one step at a time I can help you feel more confident in
> understanding decorators[1]. Because decorators are complex this is
> going to be a long article - but stick with it! I promise to make each
> piece as simple as possible - and if you understand each piece, you’ll
> understand how decorators work! I’m trying to assume minimal Python
> knowledge but this will probably be most helpful to people who have at
> least a casual working exposure to Python.
