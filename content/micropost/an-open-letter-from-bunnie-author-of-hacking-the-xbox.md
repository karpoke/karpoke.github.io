> No Starch Press and I have decided to release this free ebook version
> of Hacking the Xbox in honor of Aaron Swartz. As you read this book, I
> hope that you’ll be reminded of how important freedom is to the
> hacking community and that you’ll be inclined to support the causes
> that Aaron believed in.
>
> I agreed to release this book for free in part because Aaron’s
> treatment by MIT is not unfamiliar to me. In this book, you will find
> the story of when I was an MIT graduate student, extracting security
> keys from the original Microsoft Xbox. You’ll also read about the
> crushing disappointment of receiving a letter from MIT legal
> repudiating any association with my work, effectively leaving me on my
> own to face Microsoft.
