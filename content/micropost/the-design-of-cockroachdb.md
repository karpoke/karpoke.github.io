> CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database. The primary design goals are
> scalability, strong consistency and survivability (hence the name).
> CockroachDB aims to tolerate disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter
> failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention.
> CockroachDB nodes are symmetric; a design goal is homogeneous deployment
> (one binary) with minimal configuration and no required external
> dependencies.
