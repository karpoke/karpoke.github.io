> This is a story that dates back to the earliest days of computers. The
> story has a plot, well, sort of. It has competition and intrigue, as
> well as traversing oodles of countries and languages. There is
> conflict and resolution, and a happyish ending. But the main focus is
> the characters ” 110,116 of them. By the end of the story, they will
> all find their own unique place in this world.
>  This story (or article, as known on Smashing Magazine) will follow a
> few of those characters more closely, as they journey from Web server
> to browser, and back again. Along the way, you’ll find out more about
> the history of characters, character sets, Unicode and UTF-8, and why
> question marks and odd accented characters sometimes show up in
> databases and text files.
