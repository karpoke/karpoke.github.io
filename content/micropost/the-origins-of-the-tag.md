> to display many of the HTML extensions that we were proposing, I also
> pointed out that the only text style that Lynx could exploit given its
> environment was blinking text. We had a pretty good laugh at the
> thought of blinking text, and talked about blinking this and that and
> how absurd the whole thing would be.
