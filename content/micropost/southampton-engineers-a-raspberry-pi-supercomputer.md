> Computational Engineers at the University of Southampton have built a
> supercomputer from 64 Raspberry Pi computers and Lego.
>
> The team, led by Professor Simon Cox, consisted of Richard Boardman, Andy
> Everett, Steven Johnston, Gereon Kaiping, Neil O’Brien, Mark Scott and Oz
> Parchment, along with Professor Cox’s son James Cox (aged 6) who provided
> specialist support on Lego and system testing.
>
> Professor Cox comments: ”As soon as we were able to source sufficient
> Raspberry Pi computers we wanted to see if it was possible to link them
> together into a supercomputer. We installed and built all of the necessary
> software on the Pi starting from a standard Debian Wheezy system image and we
> have published a guide so you can build your own supercomputer.”
