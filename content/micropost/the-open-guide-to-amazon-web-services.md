> A lot of information on AWS is already written. Most people learn AWS by
> reading a blog or a “getting started guide” and referring to the standard
> AWS references. Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and
> recommendations aren’t easy to come by. AWS’s own documentation is a
> great but sprawling resource few have time to read fully, and it doesn’t
> include anything but official facts, so omits experiences of engineers. The
> information in blogs or Stack Overflow is also not consistently up to date.
>
> This guide is by and for engineers who use AWS. It aims to be a useful,
> living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices.
> It arose from discussion and editing over beers by several engineers who have
> used AWS extensively.
