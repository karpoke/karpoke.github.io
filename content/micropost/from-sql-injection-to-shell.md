Slug: from-sql-injection-to-shell

> This course details the exploitation of SQL injection in a PHP based
> website and how an attacker can use it to gain access to the
> administration pages. Then, using this access, the attacker will be
> able to gain code execution on the server.
>  The attack is divided into 3 steps:
>
> 1.  Fingerprinting: to gather information on the web application and
>     technologies in use.
> 2.  Detection and exploitation of SQL injection: in this part, you
>     will learn how SQL injections work and how to exploit them in
>     order to retrieve information.
> 3.  Access to the administration pages and code execution: the last
>     step in which you will access the operating system and run
>     commands.
