> Traditionally, design patterns have been classified into three main
> categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. There are other
> categories, like architectural or concurrency patterns, but they're beyond
> the scope of this article.
> There are also Python-specific design patterns that are created specifically
> around the problems that the structure of the language itself provides or
> that deal with problems in special ways that are only allowed because of the
> structure of the language.
