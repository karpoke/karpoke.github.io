> Learn vim and it will be your last text editor. There isn’t any better
> text editor that I know of. It is hard to learn, but incredible to
> use.
>
> I suggest you teach yourself Vim in 4 steps:
>
> 1.  Survive
> 2.  Feel comfortable
> 3.  Feel Better, Stronger, Faster
> 4.  Use superpowers of vim
>
> By the end of this journey, you’ll become a vim superstar.

> But before we start, just a warning. Learning vim will be painful at
> first. It will take time. It will be a lot like playing a musical
> instrument. Don’t expect to be more efficient with vim than with
> another editor in less than 3 days. In fact it will certainly take 2
> weeks instead of 3 days.
