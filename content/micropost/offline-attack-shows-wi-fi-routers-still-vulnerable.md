> The attack exploits weak randomization, or the lack of randomization,
> in a key used to authenticate hardware PINs on some implementations of
> Wi-Fi Protected Setup, allowing anyone to quickly collect enough
> information to guess the PIN using offline calculations. By
> calculating the correct PIN, rather than attempting to brute-force
> guess the numerical password, the new attack circumvents defenses
> instituted by companies. » [Offline bruteforce attack on WiFi
