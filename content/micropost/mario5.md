> In the history of computer games some games have created and carried
> whole companies on their shoulders. One of those games is certainly
> Mario Bros. The Mario character first appeared in the game Donkey Kong
> and became very famous within its own game series starting with the
> original Mario Bros. in 1983. Nowadays a lot of spin-offs and 3D jump
> and runs are being produced centering the Mario character. In this
> article we will develop a very simple Super Mario clone, which is
> easily extendible with new items, enemies, heros and of course levels.
>
> The code of the game itself will be written in object oriented
> JavaScript. Now that sounds like a trap since JavaScript is a
> prototype based scripting language, however, there are multiple object
> oriented like patterns possible. We will investigate some code which
> will give us some object oriented constraints. This will be very
> useful to stay in the same pattern through the whole coding.
