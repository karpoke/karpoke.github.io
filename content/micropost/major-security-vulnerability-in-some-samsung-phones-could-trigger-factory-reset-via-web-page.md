> A major security vulnerability has been discovered in some
> TouchWiz-based Samsung smartphones, including the Galaxy S2 and
> certain Galaxy S3 models on older firmware. The bug was first
> demonstrated days ago by security researcher Ravi Borgaonkar at the
> Ekoparty security conference. It involves the use of a single line of
> code in a malicious web page to immediately trigger a factory reset
> without prompting the user, or allowing them to cancel the process.
> Even more serious is the possibility that this could be paired with a
> similar glitch to render the user’s SIM card inoperable. And as the
> malicious code is in URI form, it can also be delivered via NFC or QR
> code.
