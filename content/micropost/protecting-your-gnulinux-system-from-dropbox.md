> Typical blog posts about Dropbox security concentrate on data or
> network encryption. I want to talk about protecting your system from
> Dropbox the application, as well as Dropbox the company. In this blog
> post I tell you how to prepare for a theoretical scenario where
> Dropbox turns malicious. I’ve done a number of things to make Dropbox
> run in a much more secure fashion on my Ubuntu laptop. Hopefully I
> will introduce you to some vulnerabilities that you weren’t aware of,
> and teach how to protect against them. Many of the attacks and
> defenses described here are portable to apps other than Dropbox.
