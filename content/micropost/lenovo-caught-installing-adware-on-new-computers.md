> Other users are reporting that the adware actually installs its own
> self-signed certificate authority which effectively allows the
> software to snoop on secure connections, like banking websites as
> pictured in action below. This is a malicious technique commonly known
> as a man-in-the middle attack, where the certificate allows the
> software to decrypt secure requests, yet Lenovo appears to be shipping
> this software with some of its products out of the box.
