> I extracted the certificate from the SuperFish adware and cracked the
> password (”komodia”) that encrypted it. I discuss how down below. The
> consequence is that I can intercept the encrypted communications of
> SuperFish’s victims (people with Lenovo laptops) while hanging out
> near them at a cafe wifi hotspot. Note: this is probably trafficking
> in illegal access devices under the proposed revisions to the CFAA, so
> get it now before they change the law.
