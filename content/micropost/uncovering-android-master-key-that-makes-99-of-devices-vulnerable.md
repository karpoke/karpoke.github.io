> The Bluebox Security research team – Bluebox Labs – recently
> discovered a vulnerability in Android’s security model that allows a
> hacker to modify APK code without breaking an application’s
> cryptographic signature, to turn any legitimate application into a
> malicious Trojan, completely unnoticed by the app store, the phone, or
> the end user. The implications are huge! This vulnerability, around at
> least since the release of Android 1.6 (codename: ”Donut” ), could
> affect any Android phone released in the last 4 years1 – or nearly 900
> million devices2– and depending on the type of application, a hacker
> can exploit the vulnerability for anything from data theft to creation
> of a mobile botnet.
