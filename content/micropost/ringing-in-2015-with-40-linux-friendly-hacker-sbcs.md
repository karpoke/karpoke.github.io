> In May of this year, LinuxGizmos and Linux.com collaborated on a joint
> survey, asking our readers to choose their favorite open-spec hacker
> SBCs from a list of 32 that run Linux and/or Android. Our SBC survey
> winners, ranked one to five, included the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone
> Black, Odroid-XU, CubieTruck, and Banana Pi single board computers.
> Thanks to the flood of new open-spec, community-backed boards, as well
> as the demise of others, we have updated our list for this end-of-year
> snapshot.
