> A group of cryptographers at INRIA, Microsoft Research and IMDEA have
> discovered some serious vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (e.g., Android)
> clients and Apple TLS/SSL clients (e.g., Safari) that allow a ’man in
> the middle attacker’ to downgrade connections from ’strong’ RSA to
> ’export-grade’ RSA. These attacks are real and exploitable against a
> shocking number of websites -- including government websites.
