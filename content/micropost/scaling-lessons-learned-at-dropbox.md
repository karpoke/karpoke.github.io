> I was in charge of scaling Dropbox for a while, from roughly 4,000 to
> 40,000,000 users. For most of that time we had one to three people
> working on the backend. Here are some suggestions on scaling,
> particularly in a resource-constrained, fast-growing environment that
> can’t always afford to do things ”the right way” (i.e., any real-world
> engineering project ;-). If people find this useful, I’ll try to come
> up with more tips and write a part 2.
