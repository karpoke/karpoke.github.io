> While playing around with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) we
> discovered an amazing number of open embedded devices on the Internet.
> Many of them are based on Linux and allow login to standard BusyBox
> with empty or default credentials. We used these devices to build a
> distributed port scanner to scan all IPv4 addresses. These scans
> include service probes for the most common ports, ICMP ping, reverse
> DNS and SYN scans. We analyzed some of the data to get an estimation
> of the IP address usage.
