> Although the Enigma cipher as a whole is quite complex (itâ€™s
> complexity is comparable to modern cryptographic algorithms) the
> individual transformations within it are relatively simple. In fact,
> they are simple enough that you can decipher an Enigma message with
> just a paper model.
>  Our model is three-dimensional, to illustrate the wiring of a real
> Enigma machine. It needs only common household items to construct, and
> is completely compatible with all settings of a real Enigma machine
> (models I, M1, M2 and M3).
