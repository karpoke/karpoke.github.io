> It’s an accomplishment all the more remarkable given that the story
> driving the Foundation Trilogy — an epic tale of the fall and rise of
> future galactic empires —contains virtually none of the usual tropes
> that are associated with science fiction. The novels span the entire
> galaxy, but no extraterrestrials make an appearance. It depicts the
> future history of human society, but it’s neither explicitly a utopian
> nor dystopian parable. There’s plenty of futuristic technology—from
> faster-than-light spacecraft to personal force fields—but all of this
> serves as the background, not the driver, of the plot. In fact,
> Foundation appears to contradict Asimov’s own definition of science
> fiction, as a ”branch of literature which deals with the reaction of
> human beings to changes in science and technology.” In this case,
> though, Asimov would later explain that he set out to create a genre
> he called ”social science fiction.” He used the future as a template
> to explore a pivotal idea that we’ve been asking for centuries: Are
> there laws of human history as immutable as the laws of physics?
