> Any application of typography can be divided into two arenas: micro
> and macro. Understanding the difference between the two is especially
> useful when crafting a reading experience, because it allows the
> designer to know when to focus on legibility and when to focus on
> readability.
>  This article focuses mostly on a few simple macrotypographic
> techniques”with a dash of micro”and on how to combine them all to
> build a more harmonious, adaptable and, most importantly, readable Web
> page.
