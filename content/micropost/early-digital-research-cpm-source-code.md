> Computer Scientist Gary Kildall created just such an operating system
> in 1974 for a small computer called the ”Intellec-8ó that Intel had
> designed to showcase their new microprocessors. Called ”CP/M”, it was
> unlike most other operating systems for small computers because it was
> written in PL/M, a portable higher-level language that he had designed
> earlier, rather than in the assembly-language of a particular
> computer. That meant that CP/M could be ported to run on many
> different personal computers. And if the applications were written in
> PL/M, they could be ported as well.
