> The HTML5 Web Storage standard was developed to allow sites to store
> larger amounts of data (like 5-10 MB) than was previously allowed by
> cookies (like 4KB). localStorage is awesome because it’s supported in
> all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, IE 8+, etc.).

> The standard anticipated that sites might abuse this feature and
> advised that browsers limit the total amount of storage space that
> each origin could use.
