> As software developers, we develop habits that allow us to build
> products that work and do not fail under stress. Every software
> developer knows what an ”off-by-one” error is, and like the Karate
> Kid, we train extensively so we can avoid those traps. We learn how to
> avoid these and other similar software problems and we sharpen our
> skills to find logic errors.
>
> As we mature as developers, finding logic errors and incomplete
> solutions becomes our way of life. It defines us.
>
> But our engineering strength is also our social weakness. Countless
> times as engineers you will find yourself interrupting someone telling
> a story, an anecdote or a joke to correct a false assumption, provide
> an extra fact that the narrator overlooked, give a bigger perspective
> on the problem or point out that the joke premise is actually flawed.
>
> You can identify this behavior because the person interrupting usually
> starts with the phrase ”Well, actually...”.
