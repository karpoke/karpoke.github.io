> In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called
> web apps, or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is a
> methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that: Use
> declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost
> for new developers joining the project; Have a clean contract with the
> underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between
> execution environments; Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud
> platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
> Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling
> continuous deployment for maximum agility; And can scale up without
> significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development
> practices. The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps
> written in any programming language, and which use any combination of
> backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).
