> Security is a cross-functional concern a bit like Performance. And a bit
> unlike Performance. Like Performance, our business owners often know they need
> Security, but aren’t always sure how to quantify it. Unlike Performance, they
> often don’t know “secure enough” when they see it.

> So how can a developer work in a world of vague security requirements and
> unknown threats? Advocating for defining those requirements and identifying
> those threats is a worthy exercise, but one that takes time and therefore
> money. Much of the time developers will operate in absence of specific
> security requirements and while their organization grapples with finding ways
> to introduce security concerns into the requirements intake processes, they
> will still build systems and write code.
