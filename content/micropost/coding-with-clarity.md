> Working code isn’t necessarily good code. Your code also needs to be easy to
> read, understand, and modify. It needs clarity, and to achieve that, it has
> to be organized well, with careful planning and proper separation of ideas
> taking place before you even open your code editor. Coding for clarity is
> something that separates the great developers from the merely good, and there
> are a few basic principles that can set you on that path.
