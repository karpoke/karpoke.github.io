> The roots of CGI lie in the first mechanical aids to drawing and
> painting. The earliest of these were developed to help solve a problem
> every artist has found to be sticky: perspective. Before the
> introduction of geometric perspective, the realistic depiction of
> nature was not one of the purposes of art. Instead, artists chose the
> size and position of objects in a picture by their relative importance
> to one another. A distant castle might appear to be larger than one in
> the foreground simply because it was considered more important.
