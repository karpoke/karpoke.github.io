> Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions. The

> Fools rush, and had the extra intrigue of being live during Randall
> Munroe’s Colbert Report interview. Here’s a few anecdotes from the
> development of Pixels and a quick explanation of how it works. I
> hadn’t worked with some of the graphics programming patterns
> (coordinate systems!) for a while, so I ended up making some classic
> mistakes – hopefully you can avoid repeating them. :)
