> What would ”nice looking”—or ”beautiful”, for that matter—actually

>
> -   Code should be locally coherent and single-functioned: One
>     function should do exactly one thing. It should be clear about
>     what it’s doing.
> -   Local code should explain, or at least hint at the overall system
>     design.
> -   Code should be self-documenting. Comments should be avoided
>     whenever possible. Comments duplicate work when both writing and
>     reading code. If you need to comment something to make it
>     understandable it should probably be rewritten.
