> The code behind the Google doodle celebrating Alan Turing’s 100th birthday is
> now up on Google code. This animated logic puzzle game appeared on the Google

> Our doodle for Turing’s 100th birthday showed a live action Turing Machine
> with twelve interactive programming puzzles. Turing Machines are theoretical
> objects in formal logic, not physical things, so we walked a fine line
> between technical accuracy and accessibility. We focused on finding a good
> representation for programs and choosing puzzles of appropriate complexity.
> We did considerable user testing and iteration, more than for any past
> doodle.
