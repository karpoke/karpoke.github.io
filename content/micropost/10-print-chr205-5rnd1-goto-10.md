> This book takes a single line of code”the extremely concise BASIC
> program for the Commodore 64 inscribed in the title”and uses it as a
> lens through which to consider the phenomenon of creative computing
> and the way computer programs exist in culture. The authors of this
> collaboratively written book treat code not as merely functional but
> as a text”in the case of 10 PRINT, a text that appeared in many
> different printed sources”that yields a story about its making, its
> purpose, its assumptions, and more. They consider randomness and
> regularity in computing and art, the maze in culture, the popular
> BASIC programming language, and the highly influential Commodore 64
> computer.
