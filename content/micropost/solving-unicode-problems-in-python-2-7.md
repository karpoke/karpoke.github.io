> One of the toughest things to get right in a Python program is Unicode
> handling. If you’re reading this, you’re probably in the middle of
> discovering this the hard way.

> The main reasons Unicode handling is difficult in Python is because the
> existing terminology is confusing, and because many cases which could be
> problematic are handled transparently. This prevents many people from ever
> having to learn what’s really going on, until suddenly they run into a brick
> wall when they want to handle data that contains characters outside the ASCII
> character set.
