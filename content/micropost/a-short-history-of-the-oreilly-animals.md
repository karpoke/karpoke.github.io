> In the mid-1980s, O’Reilly (aka O’Reilly & Associates) was selling
> short books on Unix topics via mail order. These books, known as
> ”Nutshell Handbooks,” were held together by staples, and had plain
> brown covers. Over time, Tim O’Reilly decided that he wanted to sell
> the books through brick-and-mortar bookstores, and hired a graphic
> designer to create new book covers. Those covers were used for the
> first two titles that were sold into bookstores, but Tim wasn’t
> satisfied with the design.
