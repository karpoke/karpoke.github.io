> <p>
> The Python reference documentation explicitly documents this behavior
> in the section on for loops:
>
> > The for-loop makes assignments to the variables(s) in the target
> > list. [...] Names in the target list are not deleted when the loop
> > is finished, but if the sequence is empty, they will not have been
> > assigned to at all by the loop.
