> Dear Sen. Rockefeller,
>
> I am a cyber expert. I invented a key technology known as ”IPS” that
> is a standard part of network defense. I invented hacking techniques
> like ”sidejacking” that are a standard part of network offense. I am a
> coder who has written a million lines of production code. I am a
> ”pentester” who has performed simulated attacks that confirm your
> worst nightmares about power-grid blackouts and financial meltdowns.
>
> Your letter [\*] was na¯ve. There is no such thing as ”best” practice,
> because there is no such thing as ”adequate” practice. The Fortune 500
> has not figured out how to stop Chinese hackers from breaking into web
> browsers, or how to separate code from data injected into websites, or
> how to stop an inadvertent connection between a secured and unsecured
> network. This has allowed me to hack (in tests) into Fortune 500
> companies, even those that follow the very best of ”best practice”.
