> CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is where it all
> began in March 1989. A physicist, Tim Berners-Lee, wrote a proposal
> for information management showing how information could be
> transferred easily over the Internet by using hypertext, the now
> familiar point-and-click system of navigating through information. The
> following year, Robert Cailliau, a systems engineer, joined in and
> soon became its number one advocate.
>
> The idea was to connect hypertext with the Internet and personal
> computers, thereby having a single information network to help CERN
> physicists share all the computer-stored information at the
> laboratory. Hypertext would enable users to browse easily between
> texts on web pages using links. The first examples were developed on
> NeXT computers.
