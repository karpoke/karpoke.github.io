> I’ve written before about the somewhat doubtful advantages of

> Since then, I’ve done more work as maintenance programmer on a Django
> project, and I’ve been reminded that library and framework design must
> take into account the fact that not all developers are experts. Even
> if you only hire the best, no-one can be an expert straight away.
>
> Thinking through things more from the perspective of a maintenance
> programmer, my doubts about CBVs have increased, to the point where I
> recently tweeted that CBVs were a mistake.
>
> So I thought I’d explain my reasons here. First, I’ll look at the
> motivation behind CBVs, how they are doing at solving what they are
> supposed to solve, and then analyse the problems with them in terms of
> the Zen of Python.
