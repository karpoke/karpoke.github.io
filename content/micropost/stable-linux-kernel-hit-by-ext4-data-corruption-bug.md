> Linux kernel developer Theodore ”Ted” Ts’o has released a series of
> patches for what he has called ”a Lance Armstrong bug” in the kernel,
> meaning behaviour that does not trip up tests but nevertheless makes
> the kernel work differently than intended. A user had reported a
> problem that caused data loss; the kernel developers quickly narrowed
> this down to a fault in the ext4 implementation that was introduced
> with the release of Linux 3.6.2 just over a week ago. Apparently, the
> data corruption bug was hard to track down as it only manifests itself
> if a system is rebooted twice in a relatively short period of time.
