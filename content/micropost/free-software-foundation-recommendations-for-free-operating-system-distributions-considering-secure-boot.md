> We have been working hard the last several months to stop Restricted
> Boot, a major threat to user freedom, free software ideals, and free
> software adoption. Under the guise of security, a computer afflicted
> with Restricted Boot refuses to boot any operating systems other than
> the ones the computer distributor has approved in advance. Restricted
> Boot takes control of the computer away from the user and puts it in
> the hands of someone else.
>
> To respect user freedom and truly protect user security, computer
> makers must either provide users a way of disabling such boot
> restrictions, or provide a sure-fire way that allows the computer user
> to install a free software operating system of her choice.
>
> Distributors of restricted systems usually appeal to security
> concerns. They claim that if unapproved software can be used on the
> machines they sell, malware will run amok. By only allowing software
> they approve to run, they can protect us.
>
> This claim ignores the fact that we need protection from them. We
> donâ€™t want a machine that only runs software approved by them -- our
> computers should always run only software approved by us. We may
> choose to trust someone else to help us make those approval decisions,
> but we should never be locked into that relationship by force of
> technological restriction or law. Software that enforces such
> restrictions is malware. Companies like Microsoft that push these
> restrictions also have a terrible track record when it comes to
> security, which makes their platitudes about restricting us for our
> own good both hollow and deceitful.
