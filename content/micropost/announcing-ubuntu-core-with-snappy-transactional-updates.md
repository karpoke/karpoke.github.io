> apps could be isolated from one another completely, so there’s no
> possibility that installing one app could break another, and stronger
> assurance that a compromise of one app won’t compromise the data from
> another? When we set out to build the Ubuntu Phone we took on the
> challenge of raising the bar for reliability and security in the
> mobile market. And today that same technology is coming to the cloud,
> in the form of a new ”snappy” image called Ubuntu Core
