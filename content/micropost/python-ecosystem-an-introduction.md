> When developers shift from PHP, Ruby or any other platform to Python,
> the very first road block they face (most often) is a lack of an
> overall understanding of the Python ecosystem. Developers often yearn
> for a tutorial or resource that explains how to accomplish most tasks
> in a more or less standard way.
>
> What follows is an extract from the internal wiki at my workplace,
> which documents the basics of the Python ecosystem for web application
> development for our interns, trainees and experienced developers who
> shift to Python from other platforms.
