> The network of sites that make up StackExchange, which includes
> StackOverflow, is now ranked 54th for traffic in the world; they have
> 110 sites and are growing at a rate of 3 or 4 a month; 4 million
> users; 40 million answers; and 560 million pageviews a month. This is
> with just 25 servers. For everything. That’s high availability, load
> balancing, caching, databases, searching, and utility functions. All
> with a relative handful of employees. Now that’s quality engineering.
