> A French coder has developed what is thought to be the smallest-sized
> chess computer program. BootChess is only 487 bytes in size, and the
> code can be run on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux computers. That makes
> it smaller than 1K ZX Chess - a Sinclair ZX81 computer game, which
> contained 672 bytes of code and had held the record for 33 years.
