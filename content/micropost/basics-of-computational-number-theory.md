Slug: basics-of-computational-number-theory

> This document is a gentle introduction to computational number theory.
> The plan of the paper is to first give a quick overview of arithmetic
> in the modular integers. Throughout, we will emphasize computation and
> practical results rather than delving into the why. Simple programs,
> generally in JavaScript, are available for all of the algorithms
> mentioned. At the end of the paper we will introduce the Gaussian
> Integers and Galois Fields and compare them to the modular integers.
> Companion papers will examine number theory from a more advanced
> perspective.
