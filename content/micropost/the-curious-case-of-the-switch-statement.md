> The earliest incarnation I can find is in ALGOL 58. The original
> description of ALGOL 58 is a fascinating read — it’s written like a math
> paper, with literal text in italics and heavy use of subscripts. Character
> classes are even named by Greek letters, with λ representing letters and so
> on. The example program at the end is completely incomprehensible, with
> almost every variable being a single letter and labels forming their own
> entire column on the left side. I guess that last bit came from FORTRAN.
