> Everything described here is based on a project I completed in early
> 2011, which was originally started several years earlier. While
> attending CanSecWest in 2009, Anibal Sacco and Alfredo Ortega from
> Core Security did a presentation on ’Persistent BIOS Infection’ where
> they demonstrated how it was possible to patch the BIOS to do some
> nasty/awesome things. Their Phrack write-up is here:
> http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=66&id=7. At the time this
> seemed really cool, but I never ended up getting the chance to try it
> out. A year later I needed to do a term project for school, so I
> decided to revisit BIOS hacking, and implement some of it myself.
