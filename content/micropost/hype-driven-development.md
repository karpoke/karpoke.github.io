> Software development teams often make decisions about software architecture
> or technological stack based on inaccurate opinions, social media, and in
> general on what is considered to be “hot”, rather than solid research and
> any serious consideration of expected impact on their projects. I call this
> trend Hype Driven Development, perceive it harmful and advocate for a more
> professional approach I call “Solid Software Engineering”. Learn more about
> how it works and find out what you can do instead.
