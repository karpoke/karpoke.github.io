> Fellow Linuxers,
>
> This is just to announce the imminent completion of a brand-new Linux
> release,
>  which I’m calling the Debian Linux Release. This is a release that I
> have put
>  together basically from scratch; in other words, I didn’t simply make
> some
>  changes to SLS and call it a new release. I was inspired to put
> together this
>  release after running SLS and generally being dissatisfied with much
> of it,
>  and after much altering of SLS I decided that it would be easier to
> start
>  from scratch. The base system is now virtually complete (though I’m
> still
>  looking around to make sure that I grabbed the most recent sources
> for
>  everything), and I’d like to get some feedback before I add the
> ”fancy” stuff.
