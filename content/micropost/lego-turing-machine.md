> This is a short documentary about the LEGO Turing Machine built by
> Jeroen van den Bos and Davy Landman at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica
> (CWI), Amsterdam (Netherlands). They built it for CWI’s exposition
> ”Turings Erfenis” in honor of the centenary of Alan Turing’s birth on
> 23 June 1912.
>  Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician who helped define the
> theoretical model of the computer as we know it today. He was a
> visionary, one of the few people of his time who recognized the role
> the computer would play for humanity.
>  The Turing Machine (1936) is an adequate model of a computer. It can
> do anything the computers of today or tomorrow can do.
