> they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest,
> whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand
> empty-handed. Full of misgivings I knocked on van Wijngaarden’s office
> door, asking him whether I could ”speak to him for a moment”; when I
> left his office a number of hours later, I was another person. For
> after having listened to my problems patiently, he agreed that up till
> that moment there was not much of a programming discipline, but then
> he went on to explain quietly that automatic computers were here to
> stay, that we were just at the beginning and could not I be one of the
> persons called to make programming a respectable discipline in the
> years to come? This was a turning point in my life and I completed my
> study of physics formally as quickly as I could. One moral of the
> above story is, of course, that we must be very careful when we give
> advice to younger people; sometimes they follow it!
