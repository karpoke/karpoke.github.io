> In the beginning there was NCSA Mosaic, and Mosaic called itself
> NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1), and Mosaic displayed pictures along
> with text, and there was much rejoicing.
>  And behold, then came a new web browser known as ”Mozilla”, being
> short for ”Mosaic Killer,” but Mosaic was not amused, so the public
> name was changed to Netscape, and Netscape called itself Mozilla/1.0
> (Win3.1), and there was more rejoicing. And Netscape supported frames,
> and frames became popular among the people, but Mosaic did not support
> frames, and so came ”user agent sniffing” and to ”Mozilla” webmasters
> sent frames, but to other browsers they sent not frames.
