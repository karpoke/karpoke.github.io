> I’ve often seen people suggest that you should learn C in order to learn how
> computers work. Is this a good idea? Is this accurate? I’m going to start
> with my conclusion right upfront, just to be crystal clear about what I’m
> saying here:
> * C is not “how the computer works.”
> * I don’t think most people mean this phrase literally, so that is sort of
>   irrelevant.
> * Understanding the context means that learning C for this reason may still
>   be a good idea for you, depending on your objectives.
