> Security researchers at Ben Gurion University in Israel have found a
> way to retrieve data from an air-gapped computer using only heat
> emissions and a computer’s built-in thermal sensors. The method would
> allow attackers to surreptitiously siphon passwords or security keys
> from a protected system and transmit the data to an internet-connected
> system that’s in close proximity and that the attackers control. They
> could also use the internet-connected system to send malicious
> commands to the air-gapped system using the same heat and sensor
> technique. The proof-of-concept attack requires both systems to first
> be compromised with malware. And currently, the attack allows for just
> eight bits of data to be reliably transmitted over an hour—a rate that
> is sufficient for an attacker to transmit brief commands or siphon a
> password or secret key but not large amounts of data. It also works
> only if the air-gapped system is within 40 centimeters (about 15
> inches) from the other computer the attackers control. But the
> researchers, at Ben Gurion’s Cyber Security Labs, note that this
> latter scenario is not uncommon, because air-gapped systems often sit
> on desktops alongside Internet-connected ones so that workers can
> easily access both.
