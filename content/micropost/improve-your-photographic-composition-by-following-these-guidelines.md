> First of all we have to define what is meant by ‘composition’.
> Composition refers to the way the various elements in a scene are arranged
> within the frame. As I’ve already mentioned, these are not hard and fast
> rules but guidelines. That said, many of them have been used in art for
> thousands of years and they really do help achieve more attractive
> compositions. I find that I usually have one or more of these guidelines in
> the back of my mind as I’m setting up a shot.
