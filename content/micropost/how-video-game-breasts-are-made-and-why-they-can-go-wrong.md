> so widely that some people seem convinced that bad breast physics are
> the result of sexism, or of an industry that likes to objectify women.
> I’ve seen unfair conjecture about whether or not developers have ever

> developers simply don’t know how to properly characterize women in

> when we have so few women developing games.
