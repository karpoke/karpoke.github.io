> While Linux is running our phones, friend requests, tweets, financial
> trades, ATMs and more, most of us don’t know how it’s actually built.
> This short video takes you inside the process by which the largest
> collaborative development project in the history of computing is
> organized. Based on the annual report ”Who Writes Linux,” this is a
> powerful and inspiring story of how Linux has become a
> community-driven phenomenon. More information about Linux and The
