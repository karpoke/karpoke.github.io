> Finally, Bradley received an e-mail from 10x, a talent company. 10x
> was started by two music and entertainment managers, Michael Solomon
> and Rishon Blumberg, who for the past nineteen years have represented
> rock stars, including John Mayer and Vanessa Carlton. Recently, in the
> wake of the digital revolution and the music industry’s implosion,
> Solomon and Blumberg have begun serving as agents for technologists.
> 10x claims to represent digital ”rock stars”; the company’s name comes
> from the idea, well established in the tech world, that the very best
> programmers are superstars, capable of achieving ten times the
> productivity of their merely competent colleagues. In HBO’s ”Silicon
> Valley,” a self-effacing character named Big Head compliments his
> friend’s coding skills by saying, ”Richard’s a 10xer. I’m, like,
> barely an xer.”
