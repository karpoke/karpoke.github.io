> You canâ€™t trust code that you did not totally create yourself.
> (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.) No amount
> of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using
> untrusted code. In demonstrating the possibility of this kind of
> attack, I picked on the C compiler. I could have picked on any
> program-handling program such as an assembler, a loader, or even
> hardware microcode. As the level of program gets lower, these bugs
> will be harder and harder to detect. A well installed microcode bug
> will be almost impossible to detect.
