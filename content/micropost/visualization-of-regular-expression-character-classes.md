> We all know the regular expression character classes, right? There are
> 12 standard classes:
>
>     [:alnum:]  [:digit:]  [:punct:]
>     [:alpha:]  [:graph:]  [:space:]
>     [:blank:]  [:lower:]  [:upper:]
>     [:cntrl:]  [:print:]  [:xdigit:]
>
> But have you seen a visual representation of what these classes match?
> Probably not. Therefore I created a visualization that illustrates
> which part of the ASCII set each character class matches.
