> Academic researchers have improved wireless bandwidth by an order of
> magnitude”not by adding base stations, tapping more spectrum, or
> cranking up transmitter wattage, but by using algebra to eliminate the
> network-clogging task of resending dropped packets of data.
>
> By providing new ways for mobile devices to solve for missing data,
> the technology not only eliminates this wasteful process but also can
> seamlessly weave data streams from Wi-Fi and LTE”a leap forward from
> other approaches that toggle back and forth. ”Any IP network will
> benefit from this technology,” says Sheau Ng, vice president for
> research and development at NBC Universal.
