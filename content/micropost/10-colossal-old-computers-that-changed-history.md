> Computers have come a long way since the early days, when two of the
> machines could take over a four-story building and weigh up to 250
> tons. As early as the 1930s, inventors, engineers and physicists were
> figuring out ways to use machines to perform complex calculations and
> processes, employing pioneering methods to achieve their goals.
> Although some of those techniques and devices are now blissfully
> obsolete, many early innovators hit upon technologies that are still
> in use today. These 10 colossal old computers are a testament to the
> alluring potential of computing and the ingenuity of early computer
> scientists – as well as a visual demonstration of just how far we’ve
> come.
