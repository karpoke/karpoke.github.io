> More than 12 million routers in homes and small offices are vulnerable
> to attacks that allow hackers anywhere in the world to monitor user
> traffic and take administrative control over the devices, researchers
> said. The vulnerability resides in ”RomPager” software, embedded into
> the residential gateway devices, made by a company known as
> AllegroSoft. Versions of RomPager prior to 4.34 contain a critical bug
> that allows attackers to send simple HTTP cookie files that corrupt
> device memory and hand over administrative control. Attackers can use
> that control to read plaintext traffic traveling over the device and
> possibly take other actions, including changing sensitive DNS settings
> and monitoring or controling Web cams, computers, or other connected
> devices. Researchers from Check Point’s malware and vulnerability
> group have dubbed the bug Misfortune Cookie, because it allows hackers
> to determine the ”fortune” of an HTTP request by manipulating cookies.
