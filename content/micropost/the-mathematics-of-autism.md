> Autism may be associated with mathematical skills. Autism researcher
> Simon Baron-Cohen has published studies that autism is more prevalent
> in the familes of physicists, engineers, and mathematicians. Unusual
> mathematical skills are reported in a small percentage of cases of
> ”classic autism.” Movies, television, and popular culture such as
> Rainman (1988), Mercury Rising (1998), and many other works often play
> up this rare association by presenting autistic characters with
> extreme mathematical abilities.
>
> It has frequently been suggested that various scientists and
> mathematicians including the Nobel Prize winning physicist Paul Dirac,
> the Russian mathematician and Fields Medal refuser Grigori Perelman,
> and Fields Medal winner Richard Borcherds have had or have Asperger’s
> Syndrome, now included in the autism spectrum. Vernon L. Smith who won
> the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002 has stated that he has
> Asperger’s Syndrome. Wired Magazine popularized the notion of an
> association of Asperger’s syndrome and autism with computer technology
> and math in the article The Geek Syndrome by Steve Silberman.
