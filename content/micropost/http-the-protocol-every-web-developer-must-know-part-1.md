> HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It’s a stateless,
> application-layer protocol for communicating between distributed
> systems, and is the foundation of the modern web. As a web developer,
> we all must have a strong understanding of this protocol.
>
> Let’s review this powerful protocol through the lens of a web
> developer. We’ll tackle the topic in two parts. In this first entry,
> we’ll cover the basics and outline the various request and response
> headers. In the follow-up article, we’ll review specific pieces of
> HTTP – namely caching, connection handling and authentication.
