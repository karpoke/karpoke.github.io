> One of the most crucial pieces of any UNIX-like operating system is
> the init dæmon process. In Linux, this process is started by the
> kernel, and it’s the first userspace process to spawn and the last one
> to die during shutdown. During the history of UNIX and Linux, many
> init systems have gained popularity and then faded away. In this
> article, I focus on the history of the init system as it relates to
> Linux, and I talk about the role of init in a modern Linux system. I
> also relate some of the history of the System V Init (SysV) scheme,
> which was the de facto standard for many Linux distributions for a
> long time. Then I cover a couple more modern approaches to system
> initialization, such as Upstart and systemd. Finally, I pay some
> attention to how things work in systemd, as this seems to be the
> popular choice at the moment for several of the largest distributions.
