> Now that use of open source has become widespread, you can often get as good
> answers from other, more experienced users as from hackers.  This is a Good
> Thing; users tend to be just a little bit more tolerant of the kind of
> failures newbies often have. Still, treating experienced users like hackers
> in the ways we recommend here will generally be the most effective way to get
> useful answers out of them, too.

> The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard problems and
> good, thought-provoking questions about them. If we didn’t, we wouldn’t be
> here. If you give us an interesting question to chew on we’ll be grateful to
> you; good questions are a stimulus and a gift. Good questions help us develop
> our understanding, and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or
> thought about otherwise.  Among hackers, ”Good question!” is a strong and
> sincere compliment.
