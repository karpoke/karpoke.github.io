> In the first part of this three-part series using a Raspberry Pi for
> network-attached storage (NAS), we covered the fundamentals of the NAS setup,
> attached two 1TB hard drives (one for data and one for backups), and mounted
> the data drive on a remote device via the network filesystem (NFS). In part
> two, we will look at automating backups. Automated backups allow you to
> continually secure your data and recover from a hardware defect or accidental
> file removal.
