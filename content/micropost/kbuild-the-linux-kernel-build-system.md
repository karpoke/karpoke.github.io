> One amazing thing about Linux is that the same code base is used for a
> different range of computing systems, from supercomputers to very tiny
> embedded devices. If you stop for a second and think about it, Linux
> is probably the only OS that has a unified code base. For example,
> Microsoft and Apple use different kernels for their desktop and mobile
> OS versions (Windows NT/Windows CE and OS X/iOS). Two of the reasons
> this is possible on Linux are that the kernel has many abstraction
> layers and levels of indirection and because its build system allows
> for creating highly customized kernel binary images.
