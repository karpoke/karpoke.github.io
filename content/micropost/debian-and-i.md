> Debian is the most influential Linux distribution ever. Of the 305
> active distributions listed on Distrowatch, 147 are derived from
> Debian, and 87 from Ubuntu, Debian’s most famous off-shoot. In other
> words, 77% of the distributions being used today wouldn’t exist
> without Debian. That makes Debian’s nineteenth anniversary on August
> 16 worth a moment’s reflection, not just technologically, but socially
> as well.
>
> For me, Debian and free software are hopelessly intertwined. While I
> had played about with Linux before, I only went hardcore when I
> started work on 5 July, 1999 at Stormix Technologies, an ultimately
> unsuccessful attempt to commercialize Debian. From there, I jumped
> ship to work at Progeny Linux System, which was founded by Ian Murdock
> and funded by Bruce Perens’ short-lived Linux Capital Group, and very
> much traded on the reputation of the two Debian leaders behind it.
>
> In those few years, I worked with some of Debian’s leading developers,
> including Branden Robinson, John Goerzen, and Jeff Licquia, and at
> conferences stumbled across most of the mover and shakers in free and
> open source software as well. In short, my introduction to free
> software was also my introduction to Debian.
