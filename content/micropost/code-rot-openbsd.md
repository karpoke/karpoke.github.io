> The background is set, you know why I took interest now it’s time to
> tell what solidified the decision. Each change made to the OpenBSD
> codebase undergoes a code review before it’s committed to the tree. If
> you managed to get that far in this article you perfectly know why I
> deem that of upmost importance. No matter how many features your
> software has, if your documentation is sub-par then your software is
> most likely useless. The quality of OpenBSD documentation is on a
> level I didn’t expect even after reading about it in so many places.
> Not only will you get information on how something works, what’s
> possible and how to use it. It will also tell you the best practices
> for using the tool and warn you about the common pitfalls.
