> Our investigation focuses on Microsoft proprietary protocols with the
> help of a network trace and references. The steps that will be covered
> are specific to authentication view (MS-Chapv2), key derivation for
> encryption and the algorithm of the compression feature (MPPE/MPPC).
> Finally, to complete our approach, we will illustrate weaknesses
> through a new forensic tool dedicated to these protocols.
>
> Mainline :
>
> Details on MSChap-v2 : The first chapter aims to understand how the
> authentication protocol works ;
>  Overview of MPPE protocol : We explain briefly the encryption
> protocol ;
>  Overview of MPPC protocol : Here, we take a look at the compression
> feature ;
>  Decipher MPPE by breaking MSCHAP-v2 : We decipher MPPE protocol with
> the help of MSChap-v2;
