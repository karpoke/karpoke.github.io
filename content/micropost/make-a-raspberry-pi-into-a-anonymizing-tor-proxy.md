> Feel like someone is snooping on you? Browse anonymously anywhere you
> go with the Onion Pi Tor proxy. This is fun weekend project that uses
> a Raspberry Pi, a USB WiFi adapter and Ethernet cable to create a
> small, low-power and portable privacy Pi.
>
> Using it is easy-as-pie. First, plug the Ethernet cable into any
> Internet provider in your home, work, hotel or conference/event. Next,
> power up the Pi with the micro USB cable to your laptop or to the wall
> adapter. The Pi will boot up and create a new secure wireless access
> point called Onion Pi. Connecting to that access point will
> automatically route any web browsing from your computer through the
> anonymizing Tor network.
