> This project is based on the entire ABC’s LOST TV show scripts, 115
> episodes in 7 seasons, that I managed to parse from Lostpedia. I also
> parsed this page with additional information about hidden characters
> relations.
>
> My aim for this project is not (only) to visualize some properties and
> patterns out of the script but actually to allow to read and enjoy the
> series in a different way.
>
> I plan to add new views (will inform through twitter), more aimed to
> reveal global patterns in the script, and I will include cliffhangers
> and writing teams information.
>
> Find more information about Lostalgic in this great article and
> interview by Greg J. Smith in Creative Applications.
>
> This project is dedicated to the Lost writers, to the open culture
> and, in particular, to the community that built Lostpedia.
