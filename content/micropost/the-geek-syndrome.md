> Nick is building a universe on his computer. He’s already mapped out
> his first planet: an anvil-shaped world called Denthaim that is home
> to gnomes and gods, along with a three-gendered race known as kiman.
> As he tells me about his universe, Nick looks up at the ceiling,
> humming fragments of a melody over and over. ”I’m thinking of making
> magic a form of quantum physics, but I haven’t decided yet, actually,”
> he explains. The music of his speech is pitched high, alternately
> poetic and pedantic - as if the soul of an Oxford don has been
> awkwardly reincarnated in the body of a chubby, rosy-cheeked boy from
> Silicon Valley. Nick is 11 years old.
>
> Nick’s father is a software engineer, and his mother is a computer
> programmer. They’ve known that Nick was an unusual child for a long
> time. He’s infatuated with fantasy novels, but he has a hard time
> reading people. Clearly bright and imaginative, he has no friends his
> own age. His inability to pick up on hidden agendas makes him easy
> prey to certain cruelties, as when some kids paid him a few dollars to
> wear a ridiculous outfit to school.
>
> One therapist suggested that Nick was suffering from an anxiety
> disorder. Another said he had a speech impediment. Then his mother
> read a book called Asperger’s Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and
> Professionals. In it, psychologist Tony Attwood describes children who
> lack basic social and motor skills, seem unable to decode body
> language and sense the feelings of others, avoid eye contact, and
> frequently launch into monologues about narrowly defined - and often
> highly technical - interests. Even when very young, these children
> become obsessed with order, arranging their toys in a regimented
> fashion on the floor and flying into tantrums when their routines are
> disturbed. As teenagers, they’re prone to getting into trouble with
> teachers and other figures of authority, partly because the subtle
> cues that define societal hierarchies are invisible to them.
