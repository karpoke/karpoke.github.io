> Like many others, I spend most of my day behind a computer. In order
> make the most of it (and to keep my body from complaining too much), I
> try to maintain an optimized setup. For example, I code in Vim, browse
> with Vimperator, and move windows around in i3. Another common task is
> filesystem navigation. I prefer to use the command-line for this, but
> typing cd \~/some/very/deep/often-used/directory over and over again
> does become cumbersome.
