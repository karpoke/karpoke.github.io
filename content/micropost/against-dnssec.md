> All secure crypto on the Internet assumes that the DNS lookup from
> names to IP addresses are insecure. Securing those DNS lookups
> therefore enables no meaningful security. DNSSEC does make some
> attacks against insecure sites harder. But it doesn’t make those
> attacks infeasible, so sites still need to adopt secure transports
> like TLS. With TLS properly configured, DNSSEC adds nothing.
