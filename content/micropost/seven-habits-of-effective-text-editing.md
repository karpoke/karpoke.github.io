> If you spend a lot of time typing plain text, writing programs or
> HTML, you can save much of that time by using a good editor and using
> it effectively. This paper will present guidelines and hints for doing
> your work more quickly and with fewer mistakes.
>
> The open source text editor Vim (Vi IMproved) will be used here to
> present the ideas about effective editing, but they apply to other
> editors just as well. Choosing the right editor is actually the first
> step towards effective editing. The discussion about which editor is
> the best for you would take too much room and is avoided. If you don’t
> know which editor to use or are dissatisfied with what you are
> currently using, give Vim a try; you won’t be disappointed.
