> ”This is a free minix-like kernel for i386(+) based AT-machines,”
> began the Linux version 0.01 release notes in September of 1991 for
> the first release of the Linux kernel. ”As the version number (0.01)
> suggests this is not a mature product. Currently only a subset of
> AT-hardware is supported (hard-disk, screen, keyboard and serial
> lines), and some of the system calls are not yet fully implemented
> (notably mount/umount aren’t even implemented).” Booting the original
> 0.01 Linux kernel required bootstrapping it with minix, and the
> keyboard driver was written in assembly and hard-wired for a Finnish
> keyboard. The listed features were mostly presented as a comparison to
> minix and included, efficiently using the 386 chip rather than the
> older 8088, use of system calls rather than message passing, a fully
> multithreaded FS, minimal task switching, and visible interrupts.
> Linus Torvalds noted, ”the guiding line when implementing linux was:
> get it working fast. I wanted the kernel simple, yet powerful enough
> to run most unix software.”
