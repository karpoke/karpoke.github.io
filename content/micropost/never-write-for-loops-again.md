> It’s been a while since I started exploring the amazing language features in
> Python. At the beginning, it’s just a challenge I gave myself to practice
> using more language features instead of those I learned from other
> programming language. And things are just getting more fun! Not only the code
> become shorter and cleaner, but also code looks more structured and
> disciplined. I’ll get into those benefits more in this article.
