> Wi-Fi radio signals are found in 61 percent of homes in the U.S. and
> 25 percent worldwide, so Karl Woodbridge and Kevin Chetty, researchers
> at University College London, designed their detector to use these
> ubiquitous signals. When a radio wave reflects off a moving object,
> its frequency changes”a phenomenon called the Doppler effect. Their
> radar prototype identifies frequency changes to detect moving objects.
> It’s about the size of a suitcase and contains a radio receiver
> composed of two antennas ;íand a signal-processing unit. In tests,
> they have used it to determine a person’s location, speed and
> direction”even through a one-foot-thick brick wall. Because the device
> itself doesn’t emit any radio waves, it can’t be detected.
