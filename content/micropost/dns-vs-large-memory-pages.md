> As everyone knows, an important threat against the Internet is that of
> a coordinated DDoS attack against the root TLD DNS servers. The way
> I”d solve is with a simple inline device that both blocks some simple
> attacks from hitting the DNS server, but which can also answer simple
> queries, offloading the main server, even if it”s failed. This can be
> done with \$2000, half for the desktop machine, and the other half for
> the dual-port 10-gig Ethernet.
