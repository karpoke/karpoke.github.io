> There was a time not so long ago when Minecraft was actually a game.
> Now, it’s an insane sandbox where people build all kinds of incredibly
> complex things… like a word processor… out of blocks. This crazy
> contraption is the work of a a third-year robotics student who goes by
> the name of Koala_Steamed on YouTube. It’s the result of nearly two
> years of painstaking work inside the Minecraft world. That’s not
> continuous, mind you. Breaks were obviously taken to do things like
> attend classes, use the washroom, and interact with people and things
> that had curves.
