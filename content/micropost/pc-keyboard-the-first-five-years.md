> The vast majority of PC users today have no memory of what PC keyboards
> looked like before the standard 101/102-key layout arrived, even though
> various OEMs do their best to mangle the standard layout in order to minimize
> usability, especially on laptops. OEM-specific modifications aside, the basic
> layout of the main block of alphanumeric keys has not changed in over 30
> years, since 1986.
>
> However, up until that point the PC keyboard layout and the keyboard hardware
> changed quite a bit, and looking at the 1981-1986 IBM Technical References is
> key to understanding a) why the standard keyboard scan codes are so complex,
> and b) why there are so many seemingly odd vendor-specific modifications of
> the standard layout.
