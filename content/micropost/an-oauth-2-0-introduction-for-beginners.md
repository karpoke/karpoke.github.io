> This article doesn’t want to be the final guide to OAuth 2, but an
> introduction to the flows that this framework is composed of. You’ll have a
> look at the four basic flows and some practical scenarios, to understand the
> involved actors and the detailed behaviors. The goal is to be able to choose
> a flow that best fits your needs.
> To make it as easy as possible, the experts will forgive me, we can say that
> there are four different versions. Or, more correctly, four different flows.
> OAuth 2 is the totality of these flows. It’s not mandatory to implement them
> all, but only the ones that you need.
