> Quincy Larson was just a ”guy in a suit in an office” and decided he
> wanted to learn how to code. So he asked around. He started by picking
> up a bit of Ruby then found himself skimming through other languages
> like Scala, Clojure and Go. He learned Emacs then Vim and even the
> Dvorak keyboard layout. He picked up Linux, dabbled in Lisp and coded
> in Python while living on the command line for more than half a year.
