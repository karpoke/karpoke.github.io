> Originally, there was kSplice as a standalone project that implemented
> stop_machine()-based patching for the linux kernel. This project got
> later acquired, and the current owner is providing live patching as a
> proprietary service, without any intentions to have their
> implementation merged. Then, due to rising user/customer demand, both
> Red Hat and SUSE started working on their own implementation (not
> knowing about each other), and announced first versions roughly at the
> same time.
