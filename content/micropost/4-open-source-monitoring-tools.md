> Isn’t monitoring just monitoring? Doesn’t it include logging, visualization,
> and time-series data? The terminology around monitoring has caused a lot of
> confusion over the years and has led to some poor tools that tout the
> ability to do everything in one format. Observability proponents recognize
> there are many levels for observing a system. Metrics aggregation is
> primarily time-series data, and that’s what we’ll discuss in this article.
