> So, what is systemd? Well, meet your new God. You may have been
> praying at the alter of simplicity, but your religion is being
> deprecated. It likely already happened without your knowledge during
> an upgrade of your Linux box. systemd is the all knowing, all
> controlling meta-deity that sees all and supervises all. It’s the new
> One Master Process that aspires to control everything it can - and
> it’s already doing a lot. It’s what init would look like if it were a
> transformer on steroids. It’s complicated, multi-faceted, opaque, and
> supremely powerful.
