> The Futurama writers had a rule that the show’s more obscure jokes
> couldn’t be central to the plot. So the background is stuffed with
> nods to mathematics, science, history, and literature. Numbers are
> often translated into math problems (instead of Studio 54, the crew
> visits Studio 1²2¹3³). Robot information is conveyed in binary (”The
> Honking” references the ”Redrum” scene in The Shining, when Bender is
> perplexed to see ”0101100101” written in blood on a wall, but then
> realizes that it reads ”1010011010” in the mirror, a series of digits
> that translates to ”666”). And of course, there’s the Alienese
> language. But the writers also built entire episodes around the
> Banach-Tarski paradox and the premise of three-dimensional characters
> entering two-dimensional space.
