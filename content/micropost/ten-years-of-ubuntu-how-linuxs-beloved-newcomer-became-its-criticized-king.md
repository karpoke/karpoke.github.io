> In October of 2004, a new Linux distro appeared on the scene with a
> curious name”Ubuntu. Even then there were hundreds, today if not
> thousands, of different Linux distros available. A new one wasn’t
> particularly unusual, and for some time after its quiet preview
> announcement, Ubuntu went largely unnoticed. It was yet another Debian
> derivative. Today, Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, estimates
> that there are 25 million Ubuntu users worldwide. That makes Ubuntu
> the world’s third most popular PC operating system. By Canonical’s
> estimates, Ubuntu has roughly 90 percent of the Linux market. And
> Ubuntu is poised to launch a mobile version that may well send those
> numbers skyrocketing again.
