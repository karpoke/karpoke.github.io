> 1.1. Inasmuch as the completed device will be a general-purpose
> computing machine it should contain certain main organs relating to
> arithmetic, memory-storage, control and connection with the human
> operator. It is intended that the machine be fully automatic in
> character, i.e. independent of the human operator after the
> computation starts. A fuller discussion of the implications of this
> remark will be given in Sec. 3 below.

> 1.2. It is evident that the machine must be capable of storing in some
> manner not only the digital information needed in a given computation
> such as boundary values, tables of functions (such as the equation of
> state of a fluid) and also the intermediate results of the computation
> (which may be wanted for varying lengths of time), but also the
> instructions which govern the actual routine to be performed on the
> numerical data. In a special-purpose machine these instructions are an
> integral part of the device and constitute a part of its design
> structure. For an all-purpose machine it must be possible to instruct
> the device to carry out any computation that can be formulated in
> numerical terms. Hence there must be some organ capable of storing
> these program orders. There must, moreover, be a unit which can
> understand these instructions and order their execution.
