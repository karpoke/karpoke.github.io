> Programming is social, too. Most people think it’s not. With
> assistance from media portrayals of programmers and sloppy stereotypes
> of our own, they think most of us would prefer to work alone in the
> dark. Some do, of course, but even then most programmers I know like
> to talk shop with other programmers all the time. They like to talk
> about the places where they are stuck, as well as the places they used
> to be stuck. War stories are the currency of the programmer community.
