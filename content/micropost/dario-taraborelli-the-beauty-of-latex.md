> There are several reasons why one should prefer LaTeX to a WYSIWYG
> word processor like Microsoft Word: portability, lightness, security
> are just a few of them (not to mention that LaTeX is free). There is
> still a further reason that definitely convinced me to abandon MS Word
> when I wrote my dissertation: you will never be able to produce
> professionally typeset and well-structured documents using most
> WYSIWYG word processors. LaTeX is a free typesetting system that
> allows you to focus on content without bothering about the layout: the
> software takes care of the actual typesetting, structuring and page
> formatting, producing documents of astonishing elegance.
