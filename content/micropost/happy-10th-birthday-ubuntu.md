> I’m putting a team of Debian developers together to work full time on
> a derivative distribution of Debian. The idea is to provide a
> high-quality regular release based on Debian unstable, ensuring that
> all patches are given back to Debian, and ensuring that the install
> disk of our distribution consists entirely of Free software. Martin
> and I spoke at length about the project and he seemed to like the idea
> very much. I’m sure he’d be happy to let you know his thoughts
> directly. If you’re interested I’d like to give you a call to discuss
> it further with you. I’m based in the UK so we’re roughly in the same
> timezone, just let me know when and what number to reach you on.
