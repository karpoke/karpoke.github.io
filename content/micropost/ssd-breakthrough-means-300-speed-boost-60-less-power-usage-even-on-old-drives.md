> A breakthrough has been made in SSD technology that could mean drastic
> performance increases due to the overcoming of one of the major issues in the
> memory type. Currently, data cannot be directly overwritten onto the NAND
> chips used in the devices. Files must be written to a clean area of the drive
> whilst the old area is formatted. This eventually causes fragmented data and
> lowers the driveâ€™s life and performance over time.
