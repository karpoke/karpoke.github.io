> Ten years ago this week, the Linux kernel community faced a daunting
> challenge: They could no longer use their revision control system
> BitKeeper and no other Software Configuration Management (SCMs) met
> their needs for a distributed system. Linus Torvalds, the creator of
> Linux, took the challenge into his own hands and disappeared over the
> weekend to emerge the following week with Git. Today Git is used for
> thousands of projects and has ushered in a new level of social coding
> among programmers.
