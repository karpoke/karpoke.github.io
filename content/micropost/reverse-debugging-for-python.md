> A ”reverse debugger” is a debugger where you can go forward and backward in
> time. It is an uncommon feature, at least in the open source world, but I
> have no idea why. I have used undodb-gdb and rr, which are reverse debuggers
> for C code, and I can only say that they saved me many, many days of poking
> around blindly in gdb.
>
> The PyPy team is pleased to give you ”RevPDB”, a reverse-debugger similar to
> rr but for Python.
