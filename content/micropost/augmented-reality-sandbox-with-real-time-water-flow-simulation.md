> Video of a sandbox equipped with a Kinect 3D camera and a projector to
> project a real-time colored topographic map with contour lines onto
> the sand surface. The sandbox lets virtual water flow over the surface
> using a GPU-based simulation of the Saint-Venant set of shallow water
> equations.
