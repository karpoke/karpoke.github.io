> This proposal adds new elements and attribute to [HTML5] to enable
> different sources of images based on browser and display
> characteristics. The proposal addresses multiple use cases such as
> images used in responsive web designs and different images needed for
> high density displays.
>
> This proposal allows content authors to provide user agents with the
> information they need to select the best image source. The current img
> element only allows for a single source of an image, but there are
> numerous use cases where document authors need to define different
> image sources depending on the factors such as the design, size
> resolution, and display density.
>
> The best image source may be an image sized appropriately for the
> display size or pixel density. Or the best image source may be a
> different version of an image that has been modified by the author to
> be suitable for a particular use (see: art direction use case).
