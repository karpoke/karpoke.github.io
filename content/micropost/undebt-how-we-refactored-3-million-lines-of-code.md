> Peter Seibel wrote that to maximize engineering effectiveness, “Let a
> thousand flowers bloom. Then rip 999 of them out by the roots.” Flowers,
> in how the metaphor applies to us, are code patterns — the myriad different
> functions, classes, styles, and idioms that developers use when writing
> code. At first, new flowers are welcome — maybe the new pattern seems
> easier to use, more scalable, more efficient, or more suited to some
> particular task than the old.
>
> As a code base grows, and the flowers proliferate, however, it becomes clear
> which patterns work and which don’t. Suddenly, code patterns that were once
> beautiful new flowers become technical debt in need of removal. When that
> happens, it’s time to start ripping. Otherwise, since developers learn by
> reading (and occasionally copy-and-pasting) from existing code, the bad
> flowers and the technical debt that comes with them will continue to grow
> unchecked.
