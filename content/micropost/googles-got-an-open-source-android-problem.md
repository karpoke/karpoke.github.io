> Never has a tweet been more true, or potentially more disastrous for a

> Android wasn’t truly open, tweeted that anyone could fork - i.e., modify -
> Android, making it ”open” in the truest sense of the word.  Unfortunately for
> Google, many OEMs took Rubin at his word. Today, Google’s Android business is
> booming, but it’s clear that Android fragmentation minimizes just how much
> Google—or its ecosystem of app developers—can make from the open-source
> mobile OS. Unfortunately, according to new ABI Research data, it’s only going
> to get worse.
