> There are just 32 pieces on a chessboard, but the number of patterns
> in which those pieces can move in the course of an individual game are
> astronomical. Still, as these maps show, despite all those different
> possibilities, each piece has a pretty clear pattern behind it. The
> maps, which track the most common trajectories of each chess piece,
> are the works of Steve Tung. Tung explained the process behind the
> maps to io9, noting that each map represents condensed data from over
> 2 million individual games of chess.
