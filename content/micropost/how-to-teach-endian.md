> One of the major disciplines in computer science is parsing/formatting. This
> is the process of converting the external format of data (file formats,
> network protocols, hardware registers) into the internal format (the data
> structures that software operates on).
>
> It should be a formal computer-science discipline, because it’s actually a
> lot more difficult than you’d expect. That’s because the majority of
> vulnerabilities in software that hackers exploit are due to parsing bugs.
> Since programmers don’t learn about parsing formally, they figure it out for
> themselves, creating ad hoc solutions that are prone to bugs. For example,
> programmers assume external buffers cannot be larger than internal ones,
> leading to buffer overflows.
