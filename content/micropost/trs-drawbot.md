> On a standard headphone plug, the left channel comes through the outer
> ”tip” contact, the right channel through the middle ”ring” contact,
> and the ground connection through the inner ”sleeve” contact. The
> acronym for these so-called ”tip-ring-sleeve” connectors is where TRS
> Drawbot gets its name. It has no microchips or circuit boards and uses
> free software to turn line graphics into sound files that make almost
> any audio device into an on-the-go robot controller.
