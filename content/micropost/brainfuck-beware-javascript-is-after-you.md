> github or npm. Keep on reading if you want to know how it works.

> > What do you know about non-alphanumeric XSS?

> The other day one of my friends asked me that question on IRC,
> pointing me to some articles on sla.ckers.org where they tried to
> create some scripts like alert(1) with non-alphanumeric characters.
