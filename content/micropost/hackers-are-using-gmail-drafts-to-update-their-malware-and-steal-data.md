> Researchers at the security startup Shape Security say they’ve found a

> form of ”command and control””the communications channel that connects
> hackers to their malicious software”allowing them to send the programs
> updates and instructions and retrieve stolen data. Because the
> commands are hidden in unassuming Gmail drafts that are never even
