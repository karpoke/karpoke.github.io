> That’s a monumental surprise. Theorists have studied Prisoner’s
> Dilemma for decades, using it as a model for the emergence of
> co-operation in nature. This work has had a profound impact on
> disciplines such as economics, evolutionary biology and, of course,
> game theory itself. The new result will have impact in all these areas
