> This past semester I’ve been working on a directed study at my university
> with Prof. Wil Robertson reverse engineering embedded devices. After a couple
> of months looking at a passport scanner, one of my friends jokingly suggested
> I hack a Furby, the notoriously annoying toy of late 1990s fame. Everyone
> laughed, and we all moved on with our lives.

> However, the joke didn’t stop there. Within two weeks, this same friend said
> they had a present for me. And that’s how I started reverse engineering a
> Furby.
