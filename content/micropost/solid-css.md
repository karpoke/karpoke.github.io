> CSS was meant to style academic documents and simple sites (eg. wiki,
> blogs) where the cascade and descendant selectors makes a lot of
> sense. Unfortunately many sites we build nowadays are way more complex
> than that, and what used to work on simple projects doesn’t scale very
> well. We need to find smarter ways to code CSS to avoid the common
> issues and re-think the way we do our work. We should learn from the
> experience of other devs working in different domains, and apply into
> our own domain. Things like separation of concerns, modularity,
> encapsulation, DRY can (and should) be applied to large scale CSS
> projects as well. The main problem is that most people who are good at
> CSS doesn’t necessarily have a Computer Science background, most of
> them started as designers and learned CSS by themselves (that was my
> case¦). That’s the main reason why I’m writing this post.
