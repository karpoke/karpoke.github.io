> While transistors have many uses, one of the less known uses by
> amateurs is the ability for bipolar transistors to turn things on and
> off. While there are limitations as to what we can switch on and off,
> transistor switches offer lower cost and substantial reliability over
> conventional mechanical relays. In this article, we will review the
> basic principles for transistor switches using common bipolar
> transistors.

> The most commonly used transistor switch is the PNP variety shown in
> Figure 1. The secret to making a transistor switch work properly is to
> get the transistor in a saturation state. For this to happen we need
> to know the maximum load current for the device to be turned on and
> the minimum HFE of the transistor.
