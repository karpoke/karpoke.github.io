> Iâ€™m a programmer. I write games. Games programmers get a lot of

> because David Horne wrote the greatest program ever written: 1k chess
> on the ZX81. David Horne is not an urban myth. David Horne achieved
> what many would even now consider impossible. He wrote a chess game,
> with AI, that ran on a poorly documented, buggy machine that contained
> only 1k of memory.
