> Using HSTS to track your browsing habits evades the features of web
> browsers designed to control more normal ”cookie” based tracking
> mechanisms. Using ”incognito” or ”private” modes means that existing
> cookies won’t be shared with sites you visit. Browsers also let you
> entirely delete cookies that could be used to track you. Because HSTS
> is a security feature and isn’t intended to be used for tracking, web
> browsers treat it differently from cookies. It is only by intentional
> misapplication that HSTS can be exploited to track users.
