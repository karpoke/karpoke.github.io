> That’s the takeaway from findings security researchers Karsten Nohl
> and Jakob Lell plan to present next week, demonstrating a collection
> of proof-of-concept malicious software that highlights how the
> security of USB devices has long been fundamentally broken. The
> malware they created, called BadUSB, can be installed on a USB device
> to completely take over a PC, invisibly alter files installed from the
> memory stick, or even redirect the user’s internet traffic. Because
> BadUSB resides not in the flash memory storage of USB devices, but in
> the firmware that controls their basic functions, the attack code can
> remain hidden long after the contents of the device’s memory would
> appear to the average user to be deleted. And the two researchers say
> there’s no easy fix: The kind of compromise they’re demonstrating is
> nearly impossible to counter without banning the sharing of USB
> devices or filling your port with superglue.
