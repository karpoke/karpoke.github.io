> I’ve had an off/on relationship with Vim for the past many years.
>
> Before, I never felt like we understood each other properly. I felt
> that the kind of programming I’m doing is not easily done without
> plugins and some essential settings in .vimrc, but fiddling with all
> the knobs and installing all the plugins that I thought I needed was a
> process that in the end stretched out from few hours to weeks, months
> even; and it the end it just caused frustration instead of making me a
> happier coder.
>
> Recently, I decided to give Vim another shot. This time around it was
> different – something in my brain switched and now for the first time
> in my life I’m proud of my knowledge of Vim. My philosophy of it has
> changed to ”less is more”, my approach was more disciplined and my
> motivation stronger. And so you don’t spend as much time learning as I
> did, I am going to lay down some fundamentals.
