> So you want to write a Lisp interpreter? Welcome! The goal of the
> Make-A-Lisp project is to make it easy to write your own Lisp
> interpreter without sacrificing those many ”Aha!” moments that come
> from ascending the McCarthy mountain. When you reach the peak of this
> particular mountain, you will have an interpreter for the mal Lisp
> language that is powerful enough to be self-hosting, meaning it will
> be able to run a mal interpreter written in mal itself.
