> Redis is advanced key-value cache and store, under BSD license. It is
> very fast, has many data types(String, Hash, List, Set, Sorted Set â€¦),
> uses RDB or AOF persistence and replication to guarantee data
> security, and supplies many language client libraries. Most of all,
> market chooses Redis. There are many companies using Redis and it has
> proved its worth. Although redis is greate, it still has some
> disadvantages, and the biggest one is memory limitation. Redis keeps
> all data in memory, which limits the whole dataset size and lets us
> save more data impossibly.
