> The algorithm converts pixels from a source image into squares in the
> Tetris playfield, one row at a time from the bottom up. To generate an
> individual square, the algorithm assembles a structure consisting of a
> rectangular region fully supported by a single square protruding from
> the bottom. When the rectangular region is completed, its rows are
> cleared, leaving behind the protruding square. Three examples of the
> process appear below
