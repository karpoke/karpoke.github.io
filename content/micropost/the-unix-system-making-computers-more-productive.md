> In the late 1960s, Bell Laboratories computer scientists Dennis
> Ritchie and Ken Thompson started work on a project that was inspired
> by an operating system called Multics, a joint project of MIT, GE, and
> Bell Labs. The host and narrator of this film, Victor Vyssotsky, also
> had worked on the Multics project. Ritchie and Thompson, recognizing
> some of the problems with the Multics OS, set out to create a more
> useful, flexible, and portable system for programmers to work with.
