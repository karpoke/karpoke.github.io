> First I looked on the Internet to see if the answer has already been

> http://www.jeffsromhack.com/products/donkeykong_tech.htm. There, Jeff
> Kulczycki breaks down the math of the kill screen, showing the formula
> that is used to compute the bonus for each level. The formula says the
> level times 10, plus 40, gives the number of hundreds in the bonus
> timer. If the result is too large it is forced back down. The key to
> this is that the level number is used in the calculation. On level 22
> an overflow occurs, leaving the player with just 400 points on the
> timer because the multiplication and addition yields a number larger
> than 256.
