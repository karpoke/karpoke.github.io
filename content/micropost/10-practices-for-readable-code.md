> I’ve been writing code for 20 years. During that time I’ve worked with 17
> teams coding different languages to build hundreds of projects. These
> include everything from a simple blog site, to APIs supporting 3,000
> requests/second, to top selling apps. From these experiences, combined with
> the books I’ve read, it’s become apparent to me what matters most in code:
> readability.
